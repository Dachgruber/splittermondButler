/**
 * the tickbar is the implementation of the classic 'tickleiste', which is the
 * battle board of Splittermond. User and enemies join the battle with a 1W6 for
 * some random start initative. Then, the battle starts with the first player,
 * and every player gets called corresponding to their turn. After some action
 * the player can either move their pointer relative to their last position or
 * set themselves to a specific point on the table
